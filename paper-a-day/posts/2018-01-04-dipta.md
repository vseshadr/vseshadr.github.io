## Problem

In the virtual memory framework in today's systems, a virtual page
can be mapped to any physical frame. Such fully-associative
mapping was necessary in early days owing to the high incidence
and cost of page faults. However, in modern systems, page faults
are rare. However, the fully-associative mapping incurs high
virtual-to-physical memory translation overhead.


## Idea

The paper shows that there is negligible increase in page faults
when moving from a fully-associative mapping to a set-associative
mapping with small associativity (1, 2, 4, or 8). With a
set-associative mapping between virtual and physical memory, the
paper uses an inverted index to lookup data in physical memory. In
other words, a virtual page can be mapped to only one of few
slots.
